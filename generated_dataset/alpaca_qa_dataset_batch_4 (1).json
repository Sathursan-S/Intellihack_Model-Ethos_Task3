Hilberg Conjecture and Relaxed Variant**\n\n* **Original Conjecture (Hilberg, 1990)**: Suggests the entropy of natural language, \\(H(W_{1:L})\\), follows a power law, \\(H(W_{1:L}) \\sim L^\\beta\\) (Equation A.3).\n* **Relaxed Hilberg Conjecture**: Proposes the bipartite mutual information, \\(I_{BP}(L/2;L) = I(X_{1:L/2}, Y_{1:L/2})\\), also adheres to a power-law growth, \\(I_{BP}(L/2;L) \\sim L^\\beta\\) (Equation A.2).\n\n**II. Analytical Relationship and Implications**\n\n* **Derivation Insight**: The relaxed conjecture is derivable from the original, as shown in Equation A.4. This demonstrates that if the original conjecture holds, so does the relaxed version. However, the converse is not necessarily true due to the potential presence of an additional linear term in the entropy of natural language, which does not affect the bipartite mutual information scaling.\n* **Information Theoretic Context**: The connection between entropy and compression rates, as hinted at in the context regarding the \"Universal Compression Code Approximation of Mutual Information,\" underscores the significance of understanding these power-law relationships. Essentially, the average compression rate (in bits) needed to store a random variable is closely related to its entropy, implying that power-law entropy growth has direct implications for the efficiency of compressing natural language",

Interconnectedness of Hilberg Conjecture and Mutual Information Scaling**\n\nThe Hilberg Conjecture (Hilberg, 1990) posits that the entropy of natural language, `H(W1:L)`, follows a power-law growth, `∼Lβ` (Equation A.3). This conjecture inherently implies the Relaxed Hilberg Conjecture, which states that bipartite mutual information, `IBP L/2;L`, also exhibits power-law growth, `∼Lβ` (Equation A.2). As demonstrated in Equation A.4, the Hilberg Conjecture leads to the Relaxed variant due to the additive property of entropy in the context of sequence splitting. However, the converse is not necessarily true, as an additional linear term in the entropy of natural language does not affect the bipartite mutual information scaling.\n\n**2. Universal Compression Code Approximation of Mutual Information**\n\nA fundamental concept in information theory, as alluded to in the context, is the relationship between a random variable's entropy and its average compression rate. Specifically, the average number of bits required to store a variable is closely related to its entropy (Shannon's Source Coding Theorem). This implies that mutual information, a measure of dependence between variables, can be approximated through the lens of universal compression codes. By leveraging efficient compression algorithms, one can estimate the mutual information between two sequences (e.g., `X1:L/2` and `Y1:L/2`) by comparing the compressed sizes of the individual sequences to the compressed size of their concatenation, providing a practical, approximation-based approach to assessing `IBP L/2;L`.\n\n**References:**\n- Hilberg, 1990 (as cited in Łukasz Debowski, 2015)\n- Equation A",

This response scrutinizes the robustness of bipartite mutual information estimation using various LLMs, with a focus on the DeepSeek V3 Base and LLaMA 3.1 70B models in comparison to the LLaMA 3.1 405B model.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n1. **Scaling Behavior Consistency**: Despite variations in estimated values, all three models (DeepSeek V3 Base, LLaMA 3.1 70B, and LLaMA 3.1 405B) suggest a power-law scaling for bipartite mutual information (Fig. A.2), aligning with the hypothesized scaling law (Eq.

Our analysis reveals a profound mismatch, with demand for long-output generation surpassing equivalent-length inputs by 2-3 times, peaking at a 15-fold disparity in the [4K,8K) word range (Figure 2).\n\n**Key Conceptual Gaps:**\n\n1. **Context Handling Capabilities**: The transition from long-context models to long-output LLMs necessitates enhanced management of long-range dependencies, underscoring the importance of benchmarks like LongBench-V2 (Bai et al., 2024c).\n2. **Output Quality and Length**: Unlike traditional long-context models, long-output LLMs must prioritize both the **length** (thousands to millions of tokens) and **quality** (logical consistency, creativity, and relevance) of generated text, as emphasized in our proposed definition (Section 2.2).\n\n**Research Implications**:\n\n* The stark 102:2 ratio of input-focused to output-focused papers in leading ML and NLP conferences (Figure 3) highlights the need for a paradigm shift.\n* The current dataset landscape, exemplified by LongAlpaca-12k and LongAlign-10k (Table 1), is ill-equipped to support long-output LLM development, with output lengths significantly shorter than inputs.\n\n**Future Directions**:\nTo bridge this gap, researchers should prioritize the development of datasets with extended output sequences, such as LongWriter-6k (Table 1), and focus on enhancing context handling capabilities to foster the growth of effective long-output LLMs.",

This analysis delves into the technical intricacies of these developments, assessing their effectiveness in evaluating long-output LLMs.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n1. **Dataset Evolution**: The creation of specialized datasets (Section 3.1) marks a crucial shift towards facilitating long-output generation, a capability essential for tasks requiring extensive reasoning or prolonged text production.\n2. **Evaluation Methodologies**: While LLM-based evaluation (e.g., Bai et al., 2024d; Quan et al., 2024) offers more comprehensive insights than rule-based approaches, its computational expensiveness and reliance on the evaluating model's capabilities are notable limitations (Section 3.2).\n3. **Model Performance**: Despite innovations in architectures and training methods, current models (e.g., Bai et al., 2024d; Pham et al., 2024; Quan et al., 2024) struggle to maintain quality and coherence in outputs exceeding 4,000 tokens, as evidenced by benchmarks like LongGenBench (Wu et al., 2024) and LongWrite-Ruler (Bai et al., 2024d).\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe development of long-output LLMs, though promising, is hindered by the challenges of evaluating extensive text coherence and quality. Future research should focus on refining evaluation methodologies to balance comprehensiveness with computational feasibility, ultimately enhancing model performance in generating high-quality, lengthy outputs. **(Word Count: 299)**",

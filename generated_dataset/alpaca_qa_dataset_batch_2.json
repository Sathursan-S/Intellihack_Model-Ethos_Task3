By invoking the relaxed Hilberg conjecture (Hilberg, 1990; Łukasz Debowski, 2015), the authors establish a theoretically grounded bipartite mutual information scaling law, distinct from conventional two-point mutual information (Ebeling & Pöschel, 1994a; Debowski, 2011).\n\n**Empirical Validation (1/3)**\nThe authors' decision to validate the scaling law using state-of-the-art LLMs (LLaMA and DeepSeek) across various natural language datasets is commendable. The observed power-law growth behavior (`𝐼𝐼∼𝐿𝐿𝛽𝛽`) provides strong empirical support for the proposed scaling law, aligning with the theoretical expectations (Fig. 1, part b).\n\n**Implications for Long-Context Language Modeling (1/3)**\nThe L2M condition's requirement for the model's state size to scale faster than the bipartite mutual information for effective long-context modeling is both intuitive and theoretically sound. This insight has significant implications for architecture design, enabling more efficient and capable LLMs for document-level understanding, multi-turn dialogue, and complex reasoning tasks (Wei et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2024).\n\n**Overall Evaluation**: 8.5/10\nThe work demonstrates a strong theoretical foundation, robust empirical validation, and significant implications for long-context language modeling. However, future research could further elucidate the **boundary conditions** for the L2M",

Recent architectures (e.g., transformers, DeepSeek) have improved efficiency but still face quadratic scaling challenges with sequence length [2, 3].\n\n**Theoretical Foundation: L2M Condition**\nOur work introduces the Long-context Language Modeling (L2M) condition, theoretically grounding the development of efficient LLMs. **Key Insight**: A model's state size for storing past information (`dim(𝒛𝒛)`) must scale at least as fast as the bipartite mutual information (`𝐼𝐼(𝑿𝑿;𝒀𝒀)`) for effective long context length modeling (Fig. 1(d)) [4]. This condition is empirically verified across transformer and state space models, trained on varying sequence lengths.\n\n**Application Implications**\n1. **Architecture Design**: The L2M condition informs the design of more efficient architectures, guiding the allocation of latent state size in relation to anticipated context lengths.\n2. **Scalability Enhancement**: By adhering to the L2M condition, developers can create more scalable AI systems, better equipped to handle extensive contexts without succumbing to quadratic scaling issues.\n3. **Performance Optimization**: Models can be fine-tuned to optimize their state size based on the predicted bipartite mutual information scaling, leading to improved long-context modeling capabilities.\n\n**References**:\n[1] Wei et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2024\n[2] Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Gu et al., 2022a\n[",
